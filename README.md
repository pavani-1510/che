### ALM1:  

1. **Electrode Potential:**  
   Electrode potential is the potential difference developed between an electrode and its electrolyte due to oxidation or reduction reactions. It determines the tendency of an electrode to lose or gain electrons.  

2. **Standard Electrode Potential (\(E^\circ\)):**  
   The standard electrode potential is the electrode potential measured under standard conditions (1 M concentration, 1 atm pressure, and 25Â°C) relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), which is assigned a potential of 0V.  

3. **Electrochemical Series:**  
   The electrochemical series is a list of standard electrode potentials of various electrodes arranged in decreasing order of their reduction potential. It helps in predicting the feasibility of redox reactions and determining the strength of oxidizing and reducing agents.  

### ALM2

1. **Prediction of Redox Reactions:**  
   The electrochemical series helps in predicting whether a redox reaction will occur spontaneously. A species with a higher reduction potential can oxidize a species with a lower reduction potential.  

2. **Determination of Oxidizing and Reducing Strength:**  
   Elements with high reduction potential act as strong oxidizing agents (e.g., \( \text{F}_2 \)), while elements with low reduction potential act as strong reducing agents (e.g., \( \text{Li} \)).

   ### 1. Advantages of Using Concentration Cells in Practical Applications:  
   - **Precise Measurement of Ion Concentrations:** Used in analytical chemistry to measure ion concentration differences.  
   - **Energy Generation:** Used in specialized power sources, such as biological and geothermal energy systems.  
   - **Calibration of pH Meters:** Helps in standardizing and verifying electrode performance in pH measurement.  
   - **Corrosion Studies:** Used to understand and prevent corrosion in metal structures.  
   - **Temperature Sensors:** Helps in temperature measurement by detecting changes in ion concentration.  

### 2. Functions of a Glass Electrode in pH Measurement:  
   - **Sensing Hydrogen Ion Concentration:** The glass membrane selectively interacts with \( \text{H}^+ \) ions in the solution.  
   - **Generating a Potential Difference:** The electrode develops an electric potential based on the pH of the solution.  
   - **Providing a Stable Reference Point:** Used with a reference electrode to measure pH accurately.  

### 3. Engineering Aspects Considered in Battery Design:  
   - **Energy Density:** Maximizing energy storage capacity per unit weight or volume.  
   - **Cycle Life and Durability:** Ensuring long-term stability and rechargeability.  
   - **Safety and Thermal Management:** Preventing overheating, leakage, and short circuits.
