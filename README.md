### **Mechanism of Corrosion**  

Corrosion is the deterioration of metals due to chemical or electrochemical reactions with the environment.  

### **1. Chemical (Dry) Corrosion:**  
- Occurs without moisture, due to direct reaction with gases like oxygen.  
- **Reaction:** \( 2\text{Fe} + O_2 \rightarrow 2\text{FeO} \)  
- **Example:** Copper oxidation in dry air.  

### **2. Electrochemical (Wet) Corrosion:**  
- Occurs in moisture, forming anodic and cathodic regions.  
- **Reactions:**  
  - **Anode:** \( \text{Fe} \rightarrow \text{Fe}^{2+} + 2e^- \)  
  - **Cathode:** \( O_2 + 2H_2O + 4e^- \rightarrow 4OH^- \)  
  - **Rust Formation:** \( \text{Fe(OH)}_3 \rightarrow \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 \cdot xH_2O \)  
- **Example:** Rusting of iron.  

### **Difference:**  
- **Chemical corrosion** occurs in dry conditions, while **electrochemical corrosion** needs moisture.  
- Electrochemical corrosion is faster and more common.  

### **Conclusion:**  
Electrochemical corrosion is a major problem and can be prevented using coatings, cathodic protection, and corrosion inhibitors.

### HA3

### **1. Hardness Calculation**  
- **Temporary Hardness** (due to bicarbonates):  
  - Mg(HCO₃)₂ = 73 mg/L  
  - Ca(HCO₃)₂ = 81 mg/L  
  - **Total Temporary Hardness = 154 mg/L**  

- **Permanent Hardness** (due to chlorides & sulfates):  
  - CaCl₂ = 111 mg/L  
  - MgSO₄ = 40 mg/L  
  - MgCl₂ = 95 mg/L  
  - **Total Permanent Hardness = 246 mg/L**  

- **Total Hardness = Temporary + Permanent = 154 + 246 = 400 mg/L**

### **2. Short Notes**  
#### **(a) Caustic Embrittlement**  
- Occurs due to high NaOH concentration in boilers.  
- Causes cracking of metal due to stress corrosion.  
- Prevented by using phosphate treatment instead of Na₂CO₃.  

#### **(b) Boiler Corrosion**  
- Caused by dissolved O₂, CO₂, and salts.  
- Leads to metal weakening and failure.  
- Prevented by deaeration, oxygen scavengers (Na₂SO₃), and pH control.

### **1. Differences Between Thermoplastics and Thermosets**  

| **Property**        | **Thermoplastics** | **Thermosets** |
|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Definition**    | Plastics that soften on heating and harden on cooling, allowing reshaping. | Plastics that undergo a chemical reaction when heated, making them permanently hard. |
| **Structure**     | Linear or branched polymer chains with weak intermolecular forces. | Cross-linked or networked polymer chains with strong covalent bonds. |
| **Reusability**   | Can be remelted and reshaped multiple times. | Cannot be remelted or reshaped once set. |
| **Mechanical Properties** | Soft, flexible, and impact-resistant. | Hard, brittle, and strong. |
| **Examples**      | Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP), Polystyrene (PS), PVC. | Bakelite, Epoxy Resin, Melamine, Vulcanized Rubber. |

### **2. Coordination Mechanism for Polypropylene Polymerization**  

- **Catalyst Used**: Ziegler-Natta or Metallocene catalysts.  
- **Mechanism**:  
  1. **Initiation**: The catalyst (TiCl₄ + Al(C₂H₅)₃) forms an active site.  
  2. **Propagation**: Propylene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) binds to the catalyst, and the double bond breaks, allowing chain growth.  
  3. **Stereoregularity**: The catalyst controls the arrangement of CH₃ groups, leading to **Isotactic, Syndiotactic, or Atactic Polypropylene**.  
  4. **Termination**: The polymer chain is released, ending the reaction.  

- **Result**: Produces **highly crystalline and strong** polypropylene used in packaging, textiles, and automotive parts.

### ALM1
### **1. Chemical vs. Electrochemical Corrosion**  
- **Chemical Corrosion:** Direct metal reaction with gases or liquids, common in dry, high-temperature environments (e.g., oxidation in furnaces).  
- **Electrochemical Corrosion:** Involves redox reactions in the presence of an electrolyte, leading to rusting and pitting (e.g., iron rusting in water).  
- **More Common in Industries:** Electrochemical corrosion due to moisture and chemical exposure.  

### **2. Sacrificial Anode vs. Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP)**  
- **SACP:** Uses reactive metals (Zn, Mg, Al) to corrode instead of the structure. Simple but requires replacement.  
- **ICCP:** Uses an external power source to provide controlled protection. Requires maintenance but lasts longer.  
- **Best for Pipelines:** **ICCP**, as it offers consistent, long-term protection over large areas.

### ALM2
### **Types of Corrosion:**  
1. **Uniform Corrosion** – Evenly spreads over the surface (e.g., rusting of iron).  
2. **Galvanic Corrosion** – Occurs between two dissimilar metals in contact (e.g., zinc corroding in contact with copper).  
3. **Pitting Corrosion** – Localized attack forming small pits (e.g., stainless steel in chloride solutions).  
4. **Crevice Corrosion** – Happens in narrow gaps where oxygen access is limited (e.g., under gaskets).  
5. **Intergranular Corrosion** – Occurs along grain boundaries (e.g., in welded stainless steel).  
6. **Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC)** – Caused by tensile stress and corrosive environment (e.g., cracks in pipelines).  

### **Factors Influencing Corrosion:**  
- **Environmental Factors:** Moisture, oxygen, temperature, and pollutants.  
- **Metal Properties:** Composition, grain structure, and surface condition.  
- **Electrochemical Factors:** Presence of anodic and cathodic regions.  
- **pH and Chlorides:** Acidity and chloride ions accelerate corrosion.  

### **Corrosion Prevention Methods:**  
1. **Barrier Protection** – Coatings, paints, and plating (e.g., galvanization).  
2. **Cathodic Protection** – Sacrificial anode (zinc for iron) or impressed current.  
3. **Alloying** – Using corrosion-resistant alloys (e.g., stainless steel).  
4. **Corrosion Inhibitors** – Adding chemicals to reduce corrosion rate.  
5. **Proper Design** – Avoiding crevices, ensuring drainage, and using insulating materials.  

These methods help extend the lifespan of metals and structures in various environments.
