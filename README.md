### ALM1:  

### 1

1. **Electrode Potential:**  
   Electrode potential is the potential difference developed between an electrode and its electrolyte due to oxidation or reduction reactions. It determines the tendency of an electrode to lose or gain electrons.  

2. **Standard Electrode Potential (\(E^\circ\)):**  
   The standard electrode potential is the electrode potential measured under standard conditions (1 M concentration, 1 atm pressure, and 25°C) relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), which is assigned a potential of 0V.  

3. **Electrochemical Series:**  
   The electrochemical series is a list of standard electrode potentials of various electrodes arranged in decreasing order of their reduction potential. It helps in predicting the feasibility of redox reactions and determining the strength of oxidizing and reducing agents.

   ### 2

1. **Prediction of Redox Reactions:**  
   The electrochemical series helps in predicting whether a redox reaction will occur spontaneously. A species with a higher reduction potential can oxidize a species with a lower reduction potential.  

2. **Determination of Oxidizing and Reducing Strength:**  
   Elements with high reduction potential act as strong oxidizing agents (e.g., \( \text{F}_2 \)), while elements with low reduction potential act as strong reducing agents (e.g., \( \text{Li} \)).

### **Mechanism of Corrosion**  

Corrosion is the deterioration of metals due to chemical or electrochemical reactions with the environment.  

### **1. Chemical (Dry) Corrosion:**  
- Occurs without moisture, due to direct reaction with gases like oxygen.  
- **Reaction:** \( 2\text{Fe} + O_2 \rightarrow 2\text{FeO} \)  
- **Example:** Copper oxidation in dry air.  

### **2. Electrochemical (Wet) Corrosion:**  
- Occurs in moisture, forming anodic and cathodic regions.  
- **Reactions:**  
  - **Anode:** \( \text{Fe} \rightarrow \text{Fe}^{2+} + 2e^- \)  
  - **Cathode:** \( O_2 + 2H_2O + 4e^- \rightarrow 4OH^- \)  
  - **Rust Formation:** \( \text{Fe(OH)}_3 \rightarrow \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 \cdot xH_2O \)  
- **Example:** Rusting of iron.  

### **Difference:**  
- **Chemical corrosion** occurs in dry conditions, while **electrochemical corrosion** needs moisture.  
- Electrochemical corrosion is faster and more common.  

### **Conclusion:**  
Electrochemical corrosion is a major problem and can be prevented using coatings, cathodic protection, and corrosion inhibitors.

------------------------------------------------
### ALM1
### **1. Chemical vs. Electrochemical Corrosion**  
- **Chemical Corrosion:** Direct metal reaction with gases or liquids, common in dry, high-temperature environments (e.g., oxidation in furnaces).  
- **Electrochemical Corrosion:** Involves redox reactions in the presence of an electrolyte, leading to rusting and pitting (e.g., iron rusting in water).  
- **More Common in Industries:** Electrochemical corrosion due to moisture and chemical exposure.  

### **2. Sacrificial Anode vs. Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP)**  
- **SACP:** Uses reactive metals (Zn, Mg, Al) to corrode instead of the structure. Simple but requires replacement.  
- **ICCP:** Uses an external power source to provide controlled protection. Requires maintenance but lasts longer.  
- **Best for Pipelines:** **ICCP**, as it offers consistent, long-term protection over large areas.

### ALM2
### **Types of Corrosion:**  
1. **Uniform Corrosion** – Evenly spreads over the surface (e.g., rusting of iron).  
2. **Galvanic Corrosion** – Occurs between two dissimilar metals in contact (e.g., zinc corroding in contact with copper).  
3. **Pitting Corrosion** – Localized attack forming small pits (e.g., stainless steel in chloride solutions).  
4. **Crevice Corrosion** – Happens in narrow gaps where oxygen access is limited (e.g., under gaskets).  
5. **Intergranular Corrosion** – Occurs along grain boundaries (e.g., in welded stainless steel).  
6. **Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC)** – Caused by tensile stress and corrosive environment (e.g., cracks in pipelines).  

### **Factors Influencing Corrosion:**  
- **Environmental Factors:** Moisture, oxygen, temperature, and pollutants.  
- **Metal Properties:** Composition, grain structure, and surface condition.  
- **Electrochemical Factors:** Presence of anodic and cathodic regions.  
- **pH and Chlorides:** Acidity and chloride ions accelerate corrosion.  

### **Corrosion Prevention Methods:**  
1. **Barrier Protection** – Coatings, paints, and plating (e.g., galvanization).  
2. **Cathodic Protection** – Sacrificial anode (zinc for iron) or impressed current.  
3. **Alloying** – Using corrosion-resistant alloys (e.g., stainless steel).  
4. **Corrosion Inhibitors** – Adding chemicals to reduce corrosion rate.  
5. **Proper Design** – Avoiding crevices, ensuring drainage, and using insulating materials.  

These methods help extend the lifespan of metals and structures in various environments.
