### **Mechanism of Corrosion**  

Corrosion is the deterioration of metals due to chemical or electrochemical reactions with the environment.  

### **1. Chemical (Dry) Corrosion:**  
- Occurs without moisture, due to direct reaction with gases like oxygen.  
- **Reaction:** \( 2\text{Fe} + O_2 \rightarrow 2\text{FeO} \)  
- **Example:** Copper oxidation in dry air.  

### **2. Electrochemical (Wet) Corrosion:**  
- Occurs in moisture, forming anodic and cathodic regions.  
- **Reactions:**  
  - **Anode:** \( \text{Fe} \rightarrow \text{Fe}^{2+} + 2e^- \)  
  - **Cathode:** \( O_2 + 2H_2O + 4e^- \rightarrow 4OH^- \)  
  - **Rust Formation:** \( \text{Fe(OH)}_3 \rightarrow \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 \cdot xH_2O \)  
- **Example:** Rusting of iron.  

### **Difference:**  
- **Chemical corrosion** occurs in dry conditions, while **electrochemical corrosion** needs moisture.  
- Electrochemical corrosion is faster and more common.  

### **Conclusion:**  
Electrochemical corrosion is a major problem and can be prevented using coatings, cathodic protection, and corrosion inhibitors.

### HA3

### **1. Hardness Calculation**  
- **Temporary Hardness** (due to bicarbonates):  
  - Mg(HCO₃)₂ = 73 mg/L  
  - Ca(HCO₃)₂ = 81 mg/L  
  - **Total Temporary Hardness = 154 mg/L**  

- **Permanent Hardness** (due to chlorides & sulfates):  
  - CaCl₂ = 111 mg/L  
  - MgSO₄ = 40 mg/L  
  - MgCl₂ = 95 mg/L  
  - **Total Permanent Hardness = 246 mg/L**  

- **Total Hardness = Temporary + Permanent = 154 + 246 = 400 mg/L**

### **2. Short Notes**  
#### **(a) Caustic Embrittlement**  
- Occurs due to high NaOH concentration in boilers.  
- Causes cracking of metal due to stress corrosion.  
- Prevented by using phosphate treatment instead of Na₂CO₃.  

#### **(b) Boiler Corrosion**  
- Caused by dissolved O₂, CO₂, and salts.  
- Leads to metal weakening and failure.  
- Prevented by deaeration, oxygen scavengers (Na₂SO₃), and pH control.

### **1. Differences Between Thermoplastics and Thermosets**  

| **Property**        | **Thermoplastics** | **Thermosets** |
|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Definition**    | Plastics that soften on heating and harden on cooling, allowing reshaping. | Plastics that undergo a chemical reaction when heated, making them permanently hard. |
| **Structure**     | Linear or branched polymer chains with weak intermolecular forces. | Cross-linked or networked polymer chains with strong covalent bonds. |
| **Reusability**   | Can be remelted and reshaped multiple times. | Cannot be remelted or reshaped once set. |
| **Mechanical Properties** | Soft, flexible, and impact-resistant. | Hard, brittle, and strong. |
| **Examples**      | Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP), Polystyrene (PS), PVC. | Bakelite, Epoxy Resin, Melamine, Vulcanized Rubber. |

### **2. Coordination Mechanism for Polypropylene Polymerization**  

- **Catalyst Used**: Ziegler-Natta or Metallocene catalysts.  
- **Mechanism**:  
  1. **Initiation**: The catalyst (TiCl₄ + Al(C₂H₅)₃) forms an active site.  
  2. **Propagation**: Propylene (CH₃-CH=CH₂) binds to the catalyst, and the double bond breaks, allowing chain growth.  
  3. **Stereoregularity**: The catalyst controls the arrangement of CH₃ groups, leading to **Isotactic, Syndiotactic, or Atactic Polypropylene**.  
  4. **Termination**: The polymer chain is released, ending the reaction.  

- **Result**: Produces **highly crystalline and strong** polypropylene used in packaging, textiles, and automotive parts.
